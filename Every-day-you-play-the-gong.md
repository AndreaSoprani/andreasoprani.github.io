# Every day you play the gong.

"Every day you play the gong." is a game developed in 3 months for the Videogame Design and Programming course of the Politecnico di Milano (Prof. Pier Luca Lanzi, Dr. Daniele Loiacono) during the A.Y. 2018/19.

I contributed as team leader (having presented the concept), game designer and programmer.
