# sprn.it

This website was originally created using the [minimal](https://github.com/orderedlist/minimal) theme for Github Pages websites by [orderedlist]. I have rewritten it using the [Leptos](https://leptos.dev) framework for Rust, copying the style and changing the font. In the future I plan to change it further and experiment with it.
